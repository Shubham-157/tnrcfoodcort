# Project Title Food Court Management And Ordering System 

This project aims to develop an ordering and management system for food courts with
multiple counters. The system will provide a user-friendly interface for customers to place
orders, view menus and make payments. The vendors will have access to a separate
interface to manage and track their orders



## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing

### Prerequisites

NPM and Springboot installed

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`
